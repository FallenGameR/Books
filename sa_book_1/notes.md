- 30 min to make VGA work story
- transparent org-wide updates
- vendor lock (email app), no standart
- network complexity - ISP+advanced load balancing vs corporate networking skills

  - Greeting (the grumpy)
  - Problem classification - what team owns (the misdelegator)
  - Problem statement - enough info to repro (the assumer)
  - Problem verification - repro can be reproduced (the mislead one)
  - Solution proposals - what are the hypotheses (the fixer of a wrong problem)
  - Solution selection - arange by likeliness (the fixer of a wrong problem)
  - Solution execution - apply the fix (the executioner on a wrong machine)

  - start preparing for the new needs/tech - prototyping, getting involved with vendors, steering direction of vendor products
  - steer people to more scalable solutions
